# Compilers Course of 2023
This is an *unfinished* compiler for cpy language part of compilers course.

I'm  uploading this incase it might help anyone understand the logic

Don't try to copy-pase/turn-in the code as the lecturer makes small changes every year and will catch you red handed :D

The lexical and syntax analyzers are working

There migh be a few bugs but this is to help students that are doing the course to get em started!

Don't judge the code i was still inexperienced :D
